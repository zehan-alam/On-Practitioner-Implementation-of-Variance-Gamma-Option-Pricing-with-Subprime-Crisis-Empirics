## On Practitioner Implementation of Variance Gamma
Please read **'Project_final.pdf'** for details

This project introduces a new practitioner's option pricing model based on the Variance Gamma process, comparing it with benchmark models such as Black & Scholes (BS), Variance Gamma (VG), and Practitioner's Black & Scholes (PBS). Utilizing MATLAB's computational capabilities, the project evaluates model performance using thousands of options during the global financial crisis. Through rigorous analysis and RMSE comparisons with market prices, the study highlights the superior efficacy of the Practitioner Variance Gamma (PVG) model, particularly evident in both in-sample and out-sample datasets. This project contributes valuable insights into option pricing models and their real-world applicability in challenging market conditions.
